  `Iâ€™m segv0, a cybersecurity enthusiast and CTF player. My journey began at a young age when my dad introduced me to coding, sparking a curiosity that grew into robotics projects like FRC and later into the world of cybersecurity. Over time, I deepened my skills, earned my CEH certification, and immersed myself in CTFs, exploit development, and reverse engineering. This blog is where I share my writeups, insights, and lessons learned along the way. `.trim();
